### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my own (non-forked) repos here are MIT licensed, so you should be able to use them freely. I wish I could make more of my client work public, but alas. 

For general questions about me or my work, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/kswedberg/kswedberg/issues/new) or [submit my contact form](https://karlswedberg.com/contact).
